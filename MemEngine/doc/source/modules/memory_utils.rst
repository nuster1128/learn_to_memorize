Memory Utilities
=================

We implement extra utilities as auxiliary components, which are loosely coupled with the above modules. We implement a storage module as a database to retain the contents of information. We also provide a display module to visualize the specific contents within the memory. Besides, we offer a client module to utilize MemEngine through remote deployment on a server implemented by fastAPI.
We also implement an automatic selector to assist developers to choose memory models with hyper-parameters for their own tasks.
